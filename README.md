# Tuneify

Tuneify is a personalized music app I'm working on, so that I can conveniently collect, listen to, download and mix my own music whenever I want. Tuneify will allow one to do the following:

* Create their own playlists, as one desires
* Download songs off of youtube
* Create mixes between two artists through Boil The Frog
* Create playlist based on a single song through Spotalike
* Eventually I might try and come up with my own similarity index for music, once I have a large enough library, and enough compute power. Not sure what it'll look like.

### Requirements:

Currently, Tuneify requires Python3, Node, and React, though I'm not sure whether or not React and Node should count as two separate things, since you can use npm to create a React project. 

The versions of npm and Python I'm currently building on are:

* Python: 3.10.2
* npm: 10.8.2
